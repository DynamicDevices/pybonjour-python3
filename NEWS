1.1.3 (2019-04-17)
------------------

* Migrate examples to python3

* Add DNSServiceGetAddrInfo


1.1.2 (2018-05-27)
------------------

* Add ServiceNotRunning error code

* Fix encoding problems with TXT Record


1.1.1 (2008-05-08)
------------------

* All DNS-SD API calls are now made after acquiring a global lock
  object.  This object is a dummy (i.e. acquire() and release() do
  nothing), except in the case where pybonjour is using Avahi's
  Bonjour compatibility layer, in which case the lock is a
  threading.RLock instance.  This is necessary because the
  compatibility layer is not thread safe.

* Added browse_resolve_query.py to examples

* Moved unit tests to test_pybonjour.py


1.1.0 (2007-06-14)
------------------

* Added TXTRecord class for generating and parsing DNS TXT records
