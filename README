Introduction
------------

pybonjour provides a pure-Python interface (via ctypes) to Apple
Bonjour and compatible DNS-SD libraries (such as Avahi).  It allows
Python scripts to take advantage of Zero Configuration Networking
(Zeroconf) to register, discover, and resolve services on both local
and wide-area networks.  Since pybonjour is implemented in pure
Python, scripts that use it can easily be ported to Mac OS X, Windows,
Linux, and other systems that run Bonjour.

pybonjour is free software, distributed under the MIT license.


Requirements
------------

pybonjour requires Python 3.4 or later.

No additional software is required to use pybonjour under Mac OS X.
To use it under Windows, the Bonjour for Windows package must be
installed on your system.  Most Linux systems use Avahi rather than
Bonjour for DNS-SD.  If this is the case on your system, you'll need
to install Avahi's Bonjour compatibility library.  (Under Ubuntu, the
package to install is libavahi-compat-libdnssd1.)  Otherwise, or to
use pybonjour under other POSIX systems, you must download, compile,
and install Bonjour from source.

Both the Bonjour for Windows package and the latest Bonjour source
code are available for download at

Documentation
-------------

pybonjour provides extensive online documentation, which can be
accessed from the Python prompt via 'help(pybonjour)'.  In addition,
the examples directory contains scripts that demonstrate basic usage
of the module.
